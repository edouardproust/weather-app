## Technologies

The application is coded in javascript, html and css, without framework. The weather is obtained using the Openweather API. The data is retrieved asynchronously (Ajax) with the async/await syntax.

## How to use:
- To get the weather for the place of your choice, click on the name of the city, enter the one you want and then press enter (as indicated in the mouse-over tooltip).
- If the name of the city is correct, the weather of the place is obtained via the API and the background image and the icon adapt to the received data
- If the city name is incorrect, an error message will be displayed and the weather of the previous city will be restored.
